Below is a concise but detailed App Description and Functional Outline for Disc, aimed at guiding a developer in the initial build. It covers key integrations, core menus, and primary functionalities that reflect your vision for a music discovery, review, and live event platform.

1. Overview
Disc is a free iOS app (initially) for music fans to:

Rate & Review albums, songs, and artists.
Discover new music through a hybrid recommendation system (collaborative filtering + LLM-based “why similar” explanations).
Explore Live Events near them, bridging digital discovery with real-life shows.
Integrate seamlessly with external streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)—without hosting or streaming music internally.
2. Core Functionalities
2.1 User Registration & Profiles
Sign-Up/Log-In

Email & password or OAuth (Google, Apple, etc.).
Basic profile data: username, avatar, location.
Profile Page

Displays user’s ratings, reviews, favorite genres, events attended.
Option to connect external streaming accounts (Spotify/Apple Music) for playlist integration or “Now Playing” data.
2.2 Rating & Reviewing
Album/Song Database

Store essential metadata (title, artist, cover art, etc.).
Initially, allow user submissions for missing entries or integrate with a third-party music database (MusicBrainz, etc.).
Rating System

Simple 1–5 stars (or 1–10 scale).
Aggregated average ratings per album/song.
Review Text

Users can write short or long-form text reviews.
Option to include hashtags or keywords for better discovery.
2.3 Recommendation Engine
Collaborative Filtering

“Users who liked X also liked Y” logic based on user ratings and interactions.
LLM Analysis

Integrate an LLM (via OpenAI API or similar) to parse user reviews and generate short explanations of why songs/albums are similar.
Use embedding or text classification to group reviews by sentiment or descriptors (e.g., “mellow beat,” “heavy guitar,” “lyrically profound”).
Recommendation Feed

Main screen or dedicated tab that surfaces new albums/songs tailored to each user.
Include short textual “why recommended” insights (LLM-generated) next to each item.
2.4 Live Events
Event Listings

Integrate APIs like Songkick/Bandsintown to pull concert data by location.
Display basic event info: venue, date/time, lineup.
User Event Reviews

After attending, users can rate the concert and write reviews.
Photos or short commentary can be added (optional).
Promoted Events (Future Monetization)

Flag certain events as featured or sponsored in the events list (back-end toggle or separate API endpoint).
2.5 Streaming Integrations (Links Only)
Spotify/Apple Music Oauth

Allow users to link their streaming accounts (scopes to read playlists or top tracks, if allowed by API).
Make it easy to open album/song links in the respective streaming app. No direct streaming in-app.
Deep Linking

A user taps “Play on Spotify,” which opens Spotify with the chosen track or album.
Possibly allow “Add to My Playlist” if the streaming service API supports write access.
3. App Navigation & Menus
3.1 Main Tabs/Sections (Suggested)
Home/Feed

Personalized recommendations: curated by collaborative filtering + LLM summaries.
Latest community reviews from followed users or top reviewers.
Search/Discover

Browse or search by artist, album, song title.
Filters for genre, rating, popularity, or user-defined tags.
“Top Charts” vs. “Underground Picks” toggles for variety.
Events/Live Music

Location-based list of upcoming concerts.
Sort by date, venue, or genre.
Check-in or indicate “attended,” leading to a review prompt.
Profile

User’s own reviews, ratings, and event history.
Settings for account info, streaming service links, notification preferences.
3.2 Secondary Menus
Review Submission/Editor: Minimal text editor with rating input, possible #hashtags or mention of other users/albums.
Notifications (in a top-right icon or separate tab):
Alerts for new followers, comments on reviews, recommended events, etc.
Settings: Manage privacy, connectivity to streaming accounts, or switch location data on/off for events.
4. Technology & Integration Points
Backend

Host user profiles, ratings, reviews, and event data in a secure database.
Possibly use a combination of SQL (user auth, structured data) + NoSQL (reviews, social interactions).
Music Database

Integrate with an existing music database API (like MusicBrainz) or seed your own partial DB with popular albums/artists.
Provide an admin console or user-driven submission for missing albums.
Event Data

Songkick API or Bandsintown for concert listings.
Geolocation to fetch events near the user’s location.
LLM Integration

External API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to generate short text for album similarity, or do summarization of user reviews.
Caching recommended: store AI-generated texts to reduce repetitive calls.
Streaming Services

Spotify/Apple Music OAuth flows for account linking (read user data if the user allows, open songs in the streaming app).
Compliance with each platform’s API policies (e.g., rate limits, usage terms).
5. Future Enhancements & Monetization
In-App Ads
Light banner ads or interstitials (careful to avoid user frustration).
Promoted Events or Artist Spotlight
Additional revenue from local venues or indie labels wanting to highlight shows/new releases.
Premium Tier (Ad-Free, Extra Features)
Potential pay-tier for power users or advanced analytics for artists/labels.
6. Key Development Priorities
Core MVP

User registration & profiles
Rating & review system (albums, songs)
Basic event listing integration
Minimal collaborative filtering for recommendation
Simple UI with main tabs (Feed, Search, Events, Profile)
LLM & Recommendation Refinement

Once MVP is stable, integrate LLM for “why similar” explanations.
Expand collaborative filtering as user data grows.
Social & Community Tools

Friend/follow system, comment threads, notifications.
This can evolve after the initial release, but planning is crucial for user retention.
Refined Monetization & Integrations

Introduce sponsored event slots or optional ads as user numbers grow.
Further streaming integrations if more platforms (e.g., YouTube Music, Tidal) are requested by users.
